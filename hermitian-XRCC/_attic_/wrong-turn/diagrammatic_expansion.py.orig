# These classes build something ('blocks' class) that looks like a nested array with lazy evaluation.
# It is specific to the kinds of fragment-divided diagrams in the XR model, which need density matrices to be computed,
#  but it is agnostic to the integrals and diagram implementation.  So should work for S, SH, etc.
