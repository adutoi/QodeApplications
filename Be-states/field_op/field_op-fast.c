/*
 * The basic operational principle is that an array of configurations is given
 * along with a state vector (having the same length).  These configurations
 * are bit strings (perhaps consisting of multiple consecutive integers), where
 * each bit represents the occupation of an orbital.  The action of field
 * operators are implemented by bit flips on copies of the configuration, while
 * simultaneously keeping track of the phase (using the prepend convention and
 * the orbital ordering described below).  After action of a string of field
 * operators on a ket configuration, the location of the new configuration in
 * a list of bra configuration is looked up, in order to find the bra onto
 * which it projects.  This look-up relies on the fact that the configuration
 * strings are stored in ascending order according to the interpretation of
 * their bit strings as integers.  This step (implemented via bisection search)
 * is the most expensive part of this algorithm.
 *
 * On the inside of this code (which may differ from the outside) we imagine
 * the binary representation of integers used to represent the configurations
 * written in the usual way, with the low bit (representing the lowest-index
 * orbital) to the right.  Therefore, to make things conceptually consistent,
 * it helps to imagine arrays written right-to-left in storage (opposite the
 * natural direction for a left-to-right reader), so that the axes of the
 * integrals/density tensors associated with the same orbital sets as the bit
 * strings run in the same direction.  This is particularly convenient for the
 * *arrays* of configuration integers that need to be used to allow for systems
 * with more orbitals than can fit in a single BigInt; the lowest-order bits
 * (that is, the lowest-index orbitals) are represented in the 0-th element of
 * such an array, and so on, so it helps to think of the 1-st element as being
 * to the left of the 0-th, etc.  These configuration integers come in as one
 * contiguous block (to ensure they are contiguous for efficiency) and get
 * chopped up as they are used.
 *
 * Ideas for making this better:
 * - allow input about what ranges of creation/annihilation have nonzero elements
 * - feed in integrals that account for frozen core while working only with active-space configs
 * - faster "find" function? (run through Ham once to make lookup table for each element)
 * - spin symmetry?

// The recursive kernel for looping over orbital indices of a string of field operators for the
// purpose of either acting an operator that is a linear combination of such strings or
// computing the separate matrix elements of all such strings.  See comments with the driver
// functions below for more context.
//
// The general principle of operation is the that driver code loops over the ket configurations.
// These configurations may be components of multiple ket states, but since resolving action of
// field-operator strings upon them is the most expensive thing, the loop over these configurations
// is pulled to the outside (in the driver code); this is followed by the loops over the orbital
// indices (done by recursion here), after which the action is completely resolved (done in layers
// to keep most effort out of the more inner loops); finally the loops over the ket (and perhaps
// bra) coefficents are most deeply nested (performed here when the recursion bottoms out).  The
// latter, lower orbital indices (for operators closest to the ket) are looped over at the
// outer-most level of recursion.  To increaes efficiency, this code dynamically keeps track of
// which orbitals are occupied and empty as the configuration is modified with each level of
// recursion.  The tricky part, which leads to more lines of code than one might first think to
// write, is to get the recursion to bottom out at 1 loop instead of 0.  This is because things
// can be made more efficient if it is known when one is at the inner-most loop, and it is the
// inner-most loop that actually matters.

// The set-up/driver for the recursive kernel, which is itself called by more specialized code to
// perform one of two actions (described shortly).  See comments with the recursive kernel above
// for more information on the implementation, and see comments with the top-level functions below
// for more information on use cases.
//
// This function (via the recursive kernel) loops over all orbital indices associated with a given
// vacuum-normal-ordered string of field operators, for the purpose of either acting an operator
// that is a linear combination of such strings onto a set of states, or computing the separate
// matrix elements of all such strings (ie, a transition density tensor).  Which action is taken
// is determined by the first mode argument.  In the former case, the left-hand states are storage
// for the action of the operator on the right-hand states (they are incremented by the result),
// and the tensors input contains matrix elements that define the operator.  In the latter case,
// the left-hand states are interpreted as bra states for the transition density tensors, and the
// tensors argument provides storage for the result (again, incremented).  For efficiency, this
// only considers strings with descending-order combinations of orbital indices for the separate
// substrings of creation and annihilation operators (written left to right, with the ket on the
// right).  This assumes that the input integrals are antisymmetric or that the output densities
// will be subsequently antisymmetrized.  This driver function specifically performs the outermost
// loop over the ket configurations, with loops over orbital indices and ket (and perhaps bra)
// coefficients delegated to the recursive kernel.
