To Do:

X 1. Restore my SH_diagrams.py temporarily, just for the sake of getting it working with my driver (test_SH.py).
  2. Morph this into Marco's code (ie, more diagrams), but in my "style".  Run with Marco's driver (test_S.py) and make sure still working.
  3. Merge my test_SH.py with Marco's test_S.py
